## How to run the tests?

## How to generate the LivingDoc?
Wait! What is a LivingDoc?
It is an extension to our SpecFlow-BDD-Framework. LivingDoc displays Gherkin feature specifications and their automated validation results as a single source of truth outside of an IDE â€“ within your browser. In short, it is an automation reporting made easy - automatically generate, display, share, review, and discuss your scenarios with your stakeholders via any browser.

To generate, make sure you installed the LivingDoc CLI first, as a global dotnet tool using command prompt.
```
dotnet tool install --global SpecFlow.Plus.LivingDoc.CLI
```

Then execute below command to generate the document with test results.
```
livingdoc test-assembly [YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY]\BuggyCarsRating\BuggyCarsRating.Tests\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\BuggyCarsRating.Tests.dll -t [YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY]\BuggyCarsRating\BuggyCarsRating.Tests\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\TestExecution.json
```
